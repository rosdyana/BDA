## HomeWork 2 - Soccer League
***
### Ideas
The idea come from my favorite sport ever, "football" or in the other side they called it "soccer". And yeah, I am a Juventino :D
### My Steps
- Using api from sportsopendata.net and football-data.org to get latest statistic
- Webservice using RShiny
- Visualization for league table ( Home - Away chart visualization )
- Top scorers ranking
- Team profile
- Team stadium map in one league
- Compare team statistic
- Deploy to hosting
- Maintenance offline data each week
- build own RestFul API
- etc
