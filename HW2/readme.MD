## HomeWork 2 - Soccer League
***
### Ideas
The idea come from my favorite sport ever, "football" or in the other side they called it "soccer". And yeah, I am a Juventino :D

### My Steps
- Using api from sportsopendata.net and football-data.org to get latest statistic
- Webservice using RShiny
- Visualization for league table ( Home - Away chart visualization )
- Top scorers ranking
- Team profile
- Team stadium map in one league
- Deploy to hosting
- Maintenance offline data each week

### To-Do
- add prediction for each league
- add plot to compare 2 team
- build own RestFul API
- . . .
